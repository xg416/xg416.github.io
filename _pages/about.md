I'm Xingguang Zhang, currently a Ph.D. candidate in ECE at Purdue University. I'm a graduate research assistant working with [Prof. Stanley Chan](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ChanGroup/stanleychan.html). I'm interested in *image and video processing*, *computational imaging* and *computer vision*. 

Previously, I got my M.S. in ECE at Purdue. I was lucky to work with [Prof. Jeffrey Siskind](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~qobi/) and [Prof. Juan Wachs](href="https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~jpwachs/) in my Master's study. I got my B.E. in Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering from Zhejiang University, China.

Except for my research, I like reading, cooking, sports (such as badminton, hiking, workout, swimming) and photography (check out photos [here](https://www.flickr.com/photos/199499311@N08/)).
